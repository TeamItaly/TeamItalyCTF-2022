I always think of the good old days, when my grandma used to cook me all my favourite recipes. I've spent years storing them in randomly placed post-its; now I've written a cool tool for my family that can store all our recipes in our home computer! Some of them are protected... I won't share my new secret pesto recipe, not even with them.

Warning! For incredibly higher security, the data is not saved on the disk: if you think your family recipes are in danger, just unplug your home computer and no one will ever steal them!
