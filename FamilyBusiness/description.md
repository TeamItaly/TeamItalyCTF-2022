I'm trying to restart the family pizza business after it was abandoned many years ago.

Unfortunately, all I've found of the secret pizza-making techniques passed on by my family for generations is in the folder I've attached.

It should contain some video tutorials but my computer won't play them. I also tried reading the instructions but I didn't understand much.
