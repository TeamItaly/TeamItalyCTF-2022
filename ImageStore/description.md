I keep too many photos of pizzas on my computer and my drive is almost full.
Unfortunately I can't simply upload them to Google Photos because I don't like public cloud.
So I decided to write my own CLI service to store all my images!

Can you read `/flag`?

This is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with:

`nc imagestore.challs.teamitaly.eu 15000`

Tip: to input a line longer than 4095 characters on your terminal, run `stty -icanon; nc imagestore.challs.teamitaly.eu 15000`.
