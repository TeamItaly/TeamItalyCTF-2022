Someone stole my top secret project for a new pasta shape!
I don't know how they did it, so I added all the checks to make sure it doesn't happen again!

I'm sure that now you can't read `/flag`!

This is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with:

`nc imagestore2.challs.teamitaly.eu 15013`

Tip: to input a line longer than 4095 characters on your terminal, run `stty -icanon; nc imagestore2.challs.teamitaly.eu 15013`.
