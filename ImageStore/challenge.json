  "description": "I keep too many photos of pizzas on my computer and my drive is almost full.\nUnfortunately I can't simply upload them to Google Photos because I don't like public cloud.\nSo I decided to write my own CLI service to store all my images!\n\nCan you read `/flag`?\n\nThis is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with:\n\n`nc imagestore.challs.teamitaly.eu 15000`\n\nTip: to input a line longer than 4095 characters on your terminal, run `stty -icanon; nc imagestore.challs.teamitaly.eu 15000`.\n\nAuthor: @napaalm",
